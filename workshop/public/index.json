Alternatively, an HDMI display, mouse, and keyboard can be directly attached to the device for access. Yet another option for some devices is to configure the device upon First Boot using a USB cable.\nSee the apporpriate nVidia guide for your device:\n Jetson Nano  While these labs are written to primarily use the host computer, it is possible to execute all the commands directly on the target device. If you wish to do that, you may need to modify the lab guides slightly.\n"

	"content": "This lab will help you set up an nVidia Jetson Nano as expected for the remainder of the labs.\nWhile your Nano may have come with the latest version of JetPack (nVidia\u0026rsquo;s SDK) pre-installed, for the purposes of this guide, a fresh installation will be created. If you are uncertain if the SDK has been pre-installed, you can follow this guide.\nStep 1: Download the SD Card Image for the Latest JetPack This guide was prepared with JetPack v. 4.5.1\n  From the JetPack SDK Page find the SD Card Image Link for the Jetson Nano.\n  Click the Download the SD Card Image link or use the following commands (Linux):\n  cd ~ wget https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-sd-card-image -O \u0026#39;image.zip\u0026#39; NB- the image is over 6GB and contains the complete OS for the Nano. The time to download this image may be significant depending on your bandwidth.\nUnzip the image  cd ~ unzip \u0026lt;zipfile-downloaded-above\u0026gt; This will expand the sd-blob-b01.img file.\nStep 2: Write the image to the SD Card   Insert an SD Card of at least 16GB (32GB or more recommended) into a card reader and insert the card reader into the host computer\u0026rsquo;s USB port.\n  Identify the device name for the card\n   Linux\n Type these commands into the terminal:\ncd ~ # or directory where you extrace the img file lsblk # inspect the list to find the disk you just inserted.  # You may need to list it first WITHOUT the card and then again to determine the device name. #  # The device name will be of the form `/dev/sd\u0026lt;x\u0026gt;` where \u0026lt;x\u0026gt; is a letter. # export disk_letter=\u0026lt;insert_your_disk_letter\u0026gt;  MacOS\n Use the Terminal app to enter these commands:\ncd ~ # or directory where you extrace the img file diskutil list # inspect the list to find the disk you just inserted.  # You may need to list it first WITHOUT the card and then again to determine the device name. #  # The device name will be of the form `/dev/disk\u0026lt;n\u0026gt;` where \u0026lt;n\u0026gt; is an integer. # export disk_num=\u0026lt;insert_your_disk_number\u0026gt; Erase the Card Required for MacOS, optional for Linux hosts   MacOS\n diskutil eraseDisk ExFAT Untitled /dev/disk$disk_num diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk$disk_num Write the image file   Linux\n sudo dd if=sd-blob-b01.img of=/dev/rdisk$disk_letter  MacOS\n sudo dd if=sd-blob-b01.img of=/dev/rdisk$disk_num # note use of /dev/rdisk above NB- writing the image may take a significant amount of time (upwards of 30 minutes) depending on the speed of your disk, USB interface, Card Reader, and the SD Card itself.\nRemove the card  # Linux diskutil eject /dev/disk$disk_letter # MacOS diskutil eject /dev/disk$disk_num Remove the card from the reader.\nStep 3: Boot and configure the device   With the device powered OFF, insert the SD Card into the device\n  Connect a USB cable to the device\u0026rsquo;s micro-USB port and an open USB port on the host OR connect and HDMI monitor, keyboard and mouse to the device.\n  Power the device ON\n  (USB Cable only) Open a serial program on the host computer\n   Linux\n Determine the device name for the serial port\nls /dev/ttyUSB* # as with the disks, you may need to disconnect, and reconnect to compare available device lists # device name will be of the form /dev/ttyUSB\u0026lt;n\u0026gt; where n is an integer # export dev_num=\u0026lt;n\u0026gt; Open the serial port \u0026ndash; using picocom as example, there are many other programs.\nsudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB$dev_num If the current user is a member of the dialout group, sudo is not necessary. It is also possible to construct udev rules to avoid sudo here.\nPress the Return key and follow the on-screen prompts to set up the device and network connections. Accept all defaults\u0026ndash;recommend expanding the filesystem to the maximum.\nThe device may disconnect after configuration\n (Monitor and Keyboard) Follow the on-screen prompts to set up the device and network connections. Accept all defaults\u0026ndash;recommend expanding the filesystem to the maximum\n  Verify SSH connectivity (Optional, but recommended) This guide assumes you will connect to the device over ssh. However, all commands can be entered directly on the device if desired.\n  From a terminal on the host or other SSH program (e.g. PuTTY on Windows):\nssh \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;.local # where hostname and user are the ones you set up in #4 and the device is on the same network as the host ssh \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; # if zeroconf is not running or other networking arrangement You have now added the device to your network and verified it\u0026rsquo;s connectivity. For the remainder of this workshop, use whatever mechanism you used to connect whenever you see ssh \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;device\u0026gt;\n"

Check cv-lab (or whatever name you gave your deployment) and click Revise. Click, Next then un-check the com.example.HelloWorld component and click, Next. Click, Next twice more, make sure everything is correct on the Review screen and click, Deploy.\n  Verify the python script is removed from the /greengrass/v2/packages/artifacts-unarchived/com.example.Helloworld directory on the target device. You may need to be root to access this directory It is normal for the directory structure to remain after components are removed.\n  You can revise the deployment to add this component back at any time if desired or add this component to other deployments as a check of the deployment function.\n    To delete the component from your account (This will remove the ability to re-deploy the component without re-creating it):\n  From the AWS IoT Management Console and Click Greengrass and then Components. Click com.example.HelloWorld link, then Delete version.\n  NB- multiple versions of the component can be created and deleted\n  The artifact will remain present in your S3 bucket\n    You can use the S3 console or AWS CLI to delete the artifacts and the bucket if desired.\n  Congratulations!! You now created functional Greengrass core and a test component\n"

As deployment can take some time (15 minutes is not unusual), this guide will also describe some basic monitoring of the Greengrass core and the deployment process.\nStep 1: Deploy the new components   Navigate to the AWS IoT Management Console and Click Greengrass and then Deployments from the left side panel. Check the box next to cv-lab and click, Revise.\n  Click, Next and check the boxes for the components you just created.\n    Click, Next two more times to advance to the Review screen, verify the information is correct and click, Deploy.

Click, Revise and unselect the components you no longer wish to have as part of the deployment. This will leave the deployment in tact, but will delete the package from the the targeted devices. You can also Cancel the deployment, which will stop any future processing. Deployments cannot be deleted.\nDeleting Components Components are independent of the Deployments. As such, they can be retained for future use or deleted. To delete the, click Greengrass, Components, then Click on the link for the un-desired component (e.g. aws.greengrass.JetsonDLRImageClassification). Click, Delete version.
